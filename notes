Pause.Tech


The idea behind Pause.Tech is a simple website/application that a user intentionally initiates when he/she would like to take a pause/break in web-browsing and computer usage. The application will track if there are any "suspicious" user events that could signify lack of "focus" or an interruption in the pausing.

Design Idea:
- A website that's extra-minimalistic--blank and let's user know time spent in pause mode.
- The ability to see a history of pausing 
- The ability to see relative measurement showing how a user is doing compared to themselves, or others.
